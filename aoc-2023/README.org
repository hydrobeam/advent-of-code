These solutions are no-std/no libc. They will only run on linux since I execute syscalls that assume a linux env.

The resulting binaries are statically linked since they do not depend on libc at all. This involves some boilerplate / minutiae, but it's fun.

There's a custom bump allocator and functions corresponding to various syscalls at [[./src/custom_alloc.rs]] and [[./src/syscall.rs]] respectively.


You've gotta have the source code for rust nightly available to build this, see [[./.cargo/config]]
